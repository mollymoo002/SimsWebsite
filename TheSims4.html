    <h1>The Sims 4</h1>

  <p>The Sims 4 is the latest game in the franchise and it is still receiving
  updates to this day. I play this game currently using The Legacy Challenge
  rules to create a large family tree.</p>
  <p>It seems there is always a gimmick with each sims game and this time is no
  different. The sims in this game express emotion and certain objects will give
  them different emotions.</p>

  <p>There is also a challenge called Rags to Riches and that means you try to make as much money
  as possible in one sim lifetime from young adult to death</p>
