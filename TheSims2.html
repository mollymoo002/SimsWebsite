<h1>The Sims 2</h1>

  <p>The Sims 2 was released in 2004 and had many major improvements from the first
  game. One of my favorite features in The Sims 2 is that your sims age up from a
  baby to an elder and then can pass away from old age. Pregnancy is first
  introduced in this game as well, in the original game two adult sims who decide
  to have a baby would just have a baby appear.</p>

  <p>There are many expansion packs with this game as well, 8 in total and
  brought with them many new mechanics. My personal favorite is The Sims 2
  Seasons and that brought spring, summer, fall, and winter activities for
  your sims.</p>

  <p>This was the first time I heard about something called The Sims Legacy
  Challenge.</p>

  <h2>The Legacy Challenge</h2>

  <p>The Legacy Challenge is a set of rules that you can follow in The Sims 2
  that starts with 1 sim that you create and ends in the 10th generation of
  children that they have. If you have more than one child in a generation, you
  must choose a child to stay in the family home and they will continue the family
  tree. I enjoyed playing this because I love large families and loved the child
  mechanics in-game.</p>
  <p>This is also when people started creating mods for the game. Mods are
  modifications to the game that were not included by the official creators.
  There are many mechanics and furniture/clothes/hair/makeup in the game,
  but many people made their own content to enhance their gameplay. Here are
  some examples:</p>
