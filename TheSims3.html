    <h1>The Sims 3</h1>

  <p>The Sims 3 is my least favorite game of The Sims franchise. One of the main
  differences between The Sims 2 and The Sims 3 is that The Sims 3 had an open
  world where your sims could go to the gym or the library without a loading
  screen in between.</p>
  <p>The reason I do not like The Sims 3 is the graphics and the overall art
  style. The mechanics from The Sims 2 are basically the same, there were some
  new additions to it like being able to use a color wheel to choose the color of
  anything in the game from furniture to hair and eye color.</p>
